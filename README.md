# Scrapy Tutorial

This guide will walk you through setting up a Scrapy project for web scraping. Follow these steps to get started.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Begin by cloning the repository into your desired folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oMarquess/scrapy_tutorial.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the Repository**

   Change your directory into the cloned folder:

   ```bash
   cd scrapy_tutorial
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   For isolation, create a virtual environment for the project. Replace `[name_of_virtual_environment]` with your desired environment name:

   ```bash
   python -m venv [name_of_virtual_environment]
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   Navigate into the virtual environment's `Scripts` folder and activate it. Note: The activation command differs between operating systems. For Windows:

   ```bash
   cd [name_of_virtual_environment]\Scripts
   activate
   ```

   If you're using Linux or Mac:

   ```bash
   source [name_of_virtual_environment]/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Navigate Back to the Project Folder**

   Change your directory back to the project root:

   ```bash
   cd ../..
   ```

6. **Create a New Folder**

   Make a new folder where you'll place your Scrapy project. Replace `[folder_name]` with your desired folder name:

   ```bash
   mkdir [folder_name]
   ```

7. **Navigate into Your New Folder**

   Move into the new folder you've created:

   ```bash
   cd [folder_name]
   ```

8. **Install Scrapy**

   Install Scrapy within your virtual environment:

   ```bash
   pip install Scrapy
   ```
